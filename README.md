# F1-Champions
This project contain data of Formula 1 history from 1950 to 2021.

I have did so many stages in this project which all include:
  * Data Preprocessing 
  * EDA
  * Statistics 
  * Normalization
  * Machine Learning (Supervised Learning Classification)
 
Machine Learning algorithms used:
  * Logistic Regression
  * SGD Classifier
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * KNeighbors Classifier (KNN)
  * Gaussian NB (Navie Bayes)
  * Decision Tree Classifier

Higlhlights:
  * Each stage are well explained
  * ploted using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/21.84/82.79) (zoom in/out and pin shows the name of the track)
  * Target column as driver name
  * Higher accuracy in all classification algorithms
